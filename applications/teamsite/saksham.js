        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Saksham Manandhar and I am a senior
          here at San Francisco State University. This is my last semester
          and I'm looking forward to graduating this spring. Apart from 
          spending my time coding, I am a huge sports fanatic and love to 
          watch and keep up to date on sports. Additional acitivities I enjoy
          include working out and sometimes gaming.
